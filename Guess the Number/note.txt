How to select element in Javascript??

document.querySelector('.className');
document.querySelector('#id');

to get only the text in the selected element we need to declare 
: document.querySelector('.className').textContent;

What is DOM and DOM Manipulation?
=> DOM stands for document object model. Dom is a structured representaion of HTML documents allows javascript to access HTML elements and 
styles to Manipulate them.
We will be able to change text ,html attributes and css styles to javascript code.

DOM !== Javascript 

DOM is not a part of javascript. Dom and DOM method actually part of web api. Web api can interact with Javascript.
Web api's are the libraries that can be accessed with javascript code.
API = Aplication Program interface. 

We can set the textContent to something else using querySelector.
example:  
        document.querySelector('.message').textContent = 'Correct Number!';


This procedure will work for only item where there is some previous text available. But for input 
field you have to define value instead of textContent.
example:
        console.log((document.querySelector('.guess').value));
  

  ######## Class 2 ########
  ** function is a value.

Handling Click Event
when we click on any button then something should happen.
document.querySelector('.check).addEventListener('click',function(){
        console.log(document.querySelector(.guess).value);
})


querySelector('.check) this will select the class check.
addEventListener('click',function() this will add an event which will work only when a event occurs. This event can be 
click event and also many more. First argument work for click and 2nd argument is normal function and can do function works.


usually whenever we get something from the interface we get string. so we have to chnge it in number before changing it


const number = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 20 + 1);

Here math.random() will give a value in between 0-.99999.......
Math.random()*20 will give a value in between 0 - 19.9999999999...........
Math.trunc(Math.random()*20) will give a value between 0-19 //it will trunc the .99999 number / decimal numbers.
but we want 0-20 thats why we need to add 1 here.
Math.trunc(Math.random()*20)+1;


######### CSS dom manipulation #######

To change a color of css after a certain task : 
document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = '#60b347';

here we have to define style as we are going to change the css color or property. Then we have to select the property we want to change.
In this case backgroundColor.. And we have to right backgroundColor in camelcase we cannot do (background-color ðŸš«) this - is not valid in javascript.

the value ('#60b347') always needs to be string.
